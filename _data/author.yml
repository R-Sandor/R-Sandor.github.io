  <h3>About Me&#58; </h3>
  <p>
    Linux fanatic that's been passionately solving problems with technology for the past 13 years.
    Background in writing applications in C++, Java, Golang, Typescript, Javascript, CSS and HTLM.
    Building on frameworks such as ReactJS, Vue3, and Spring Boot.
    The area that I find myself excelling at is piecing all the components together, 
    from Kubernetes to deploy on, docker to ship/containerize, and lastly to the data that 
    makes any of it meaningful.
